# Stress-calculator
The Ayurvedic Stress Level Calculator is a lightweight, responsive web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It is designed to help users evaluate their stress levels through a traditional Ayurvedic approach.
The tool presents 10 multiple-choice questions related to lifestyle, emotional health, digestion, sleep, and coping mechanisms. Each option is assigned a score (10, 8, 5, or 2), reflecting the quality of the user's habits. After submitting their answers, the calculator sums the scores and categorizes the user into one of four stress levels:

ðŸŸ¢ Balanced Ojas (90â€“100)

ðŸŸ¡ Mild Stress (75â€“89)

ðŸŸ  Moderate Stress (50â€“74)

ðŸ”´ High Stress (Below 50)

A dynamic SVG-based gauge meter visually represents the userâ€™s stress score with a rotating needle and a color-coded arc. The gauge animates smoothly upon calculation, providing immediate visual feedback. The stress score is also displayed numerically beneath the gauge, along with a tailored message encouraging wellness.
